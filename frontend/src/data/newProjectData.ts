    tpm: "Jordan Leis, Devon Kisob",
    description:
      "The Microgrid RL project at WAT.ai focuses on developing and assessing reinforcement learning (RL) architectures designed for autonomous optimization of renewable-powered microgrids in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. Utilizing realistic simulations integrated with NASA's POWER API weather data, the team evaluates state-of-the-art RL methods, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to effectively manage energy storage, renewable generation, and load balancing. The goal is to identify the most robust and efficient solution, ultimately enhancing energy accessibility and reducing operational barriers in energy-deficient regions.",

    description:
      "In recent years, advancements in conversational AI have led to the development of intelligent tutoring systems to enhance learning experiences through interactive conversation. This project, Oliver, is an innovative virtual teaching assistant and course management system that leverages contextual memory and response strategies designed to promote active learning and critical thinking. Unlike traditional models that frequently offer direct answers, Oliver encourages exploration and comprehension. Through our research paper, we underscore Oliver's potential to serve as a powerful tool in education, supporting learners in developing deeper cognitive skills rather than relying on rote memorization.",

    tpm: "Rishabh Sharma, Ahash Ganeshamoorthy, Jatin Mehta",
    description:
      "Surgical diagnosis has always been very observational, decisions were based off of what could be seen. There have been many successful attempts to add more quantitative metrics in medicine, but still diagnoses tend to be 'one-size-fits-all'. The next big leap in the field comes in the form of personalized medicine, where each patient has their own customized treatment that's shaped through empirical research. We are developing a platform where surgeons can upload ultrasounds of an artery, which is then turned into a 3D mesh and is run through our ML model. This model, trained on geometric and physics-based data from ultrasounds, allows us to quickly and accurately predict critical flow parameters for surgeries like coronary interventions. The goal is to minimize the cost to make these parameters available to surgeons from any clinic, making diagnoses more informed.",

    title: "Audio Temporal Segmentation & Sentiment Analysis",
    tpm: "Krish Patel, Sahal Sajeer Kalandan",
    description:
      "Our project aims to analyze audio signals to detect phrases and understand emotions. We break down audio into smaller parts (called phrases) and study their patterns over time. This is done using a supervised dataset of audio with labeled phrases and different emotional tags corresponding to each phrase. By looking at the frequency and timing of sounds, we can predict and identify key phrases. We also apply language processing methods to analyze the emotional tone of the audio. This helps improve technologies like phrase detection and language analysis in various multimedia applications.",

Our approach will attempt to train agents to make good decisions in gamified environments like Monopoly. We will then see how this training 'generalises' (transfers) to a real-life context using the case study of politics. The 'product' outcome is getting a good political decision-making agent. The 'research' outcome is testing the generalisation of the agent's decision making capabilities.",

    description:
      "Access to high-quality, microscale data on local wind patterns is essential for determining optimal placements of wind farms. While this has traditionally been achieved through the use of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to super-resolve mesoscale data, these are slow and costly to produce. We propose using recent advances in diffusion models to produce scalable and accurate microscale data at a fraction of the cost of LES models. We also leverage conditional information from the domain of interest to further improve our generations.",
