    title: "PlayFitt Recommender System",
    tpm: "Ben Bates, Richard Wills",
    coreMembers: "Will Erf, Kristof Sochan, Nolan White-Roy, Ross Cleary",
    description:
      "Our objective is to help people be more active! We developed a recommender system for the PlayFitt fitness app using a contextual bandit algorithm. This takes into account information about the users as context, and makes decisions about rep counts and reward values to suggest. Notably, this approach enables online learning.",

    description:
      "The goal of our project is to benchmark performance of several deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jax, MxNet, Flux.jl, and KNet.jl. We build models from scratch in each framework and test them on common datasets.",

    tpm: "Amya Singhal, Thomas Fortin",
    coreMembers: "Alex He, Alexander Hutchinson, Ishaan Patel, Shivam Jindal",
    description:
      "We are developing an artificial intelligence chess engine based on the work of Deep Mind on their chess engine‚îÅAlpha-Zero. We are also iteratively testing and modifying the model to improve performance on hardware with much more limited processing power than what was available to Deep Mind when creating Alpha-Zero.",
