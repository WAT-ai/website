    description:
      "Our project aims to analyze audio signals to detect phrases and understand emotions. We break down audio into smaller parts (called phrases) and study their patterns over time. This is done using a supervised dataset of audio with labeled phrases and different emotional tags corresponding to each phrase. By looking at the frequency and timing of sounds, we can predict and identify key phrases. We also apply language processing methods to analyze the emotional tone of the audio. This helps improve technologies like phrase detection and language analysis in various multimedia applications.",

This project focuses on improving short-term prandial (meal-time) and postprandial blood glucose outcomes for people with type 1 diabetes, a complex disease that affects nearly 10 million people worldwide. We aim to leverage semi-supervised learning to identify unlabelled meals in time-series blood glucose data, develop meal-scoring functions, and explore causal machine-learning techniques. Our goal is to provide actionable insights to PWD and their care practitioners, enhancing health outcomes and quality of life.",

    description:
      "Use of copyrighted content in training generative AI models has increased significantly as the field has emerged, however, it is challenging to know whether a model is using copyrighted material in its training data. There are two project goals The first is to develop tools to detect whether a piece of given content was used in training data of an LLM. The second is to build an open-source RAG-based logging system to keep track of pieces of flagged media that have been found in the training data of publicly available LLMs.",

We will then see how this training ‘generalises’ (transfers) to a real-life context using the case study of politics. The ‘product’ outcome is getting a good political decision-making agent. The ‘research’ outcome is testing the generalisation of the agent’s decision making capabilities.",

      "Access to high-quality, microscale data on local wind patterns is essential for determining optimal placements of wind farms. While this has traditionally been achieved through the use of Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to super-resolve mesoscale data, these are slow and costly to produce. We propose using recent advances in diffusion models to produce scalable and accurate microscale data at a fraction of the cost of LES models. We also leverage conditional information from the domain of interest to further improve our generations.",
